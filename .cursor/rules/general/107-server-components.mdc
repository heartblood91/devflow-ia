description: Use React Server Components for async server-side operations in Next.js 15.
globs: *.tsx
---
## Context

* React Server Components run only on the server and enable async operations.
* Use for database queries, file system operations, and backend logic directly in components.

## Usage

Use async server components for backend operations in pages and layouts:

```tsx
// Use "async" for server components
export default async function Page() {
  // Use "await" for async operations
  const result = await prisma.user.findMany();
  return (
    <div>
      {result.map((user) => (
        <p>{user.name}</p>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Server components can perform backend operations including:

* Prisma database queries
* File system operations
* Analytics tracking
* Third-party API calls

Available Next.js server methods: 

```tsx
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation'

// Redirect to another page
redirect('/login');

// Show the `not-found.tsx` file
notFound()
```

Server component rules:

1. Server components must be `async` functions
2. Cannot use React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
3. Cannot access browser APIs (document, window) as they run server-side only
