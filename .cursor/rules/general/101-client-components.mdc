## Context

* Since React 19 and Next.js 13, we have Client Components.
* This project uses Client Components and [107-server-components.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/general/107-server-components.mdc) to work.
* Client Components allow you to write interactive UI elements that are pre-rendered on the server and can use client-side JavaScript to run in the browser.

## Why Client Components?

1. **Interactivity**: Client Components can use state, effects, and event listeners, meaning they can provide immediate feedback to the user and update the UI dynamically.
2. **Browser APIs**: Client Components have access to browser APIs, such as geolocation or localStorage, enabling richer functionality.

## Example:

```tsx
'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Rules:

1. Client Components must start with `'use client'`.
2. Client Components can use `useState` and other React hooks.
3. Client Components are pre-rendered on the server, which means they can create hydration errors.
4. Avoid hydration errors by using hooks like `@use-is-client.ts` or checking `typeof window` when using Browser APIs.
