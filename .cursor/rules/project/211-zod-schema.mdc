description: Use this rule to enforce consistent naming conventions for Zod schemas and their type extractions.
globs: *.store.ts, *.ts
---

## Context

- Zod schemas are used to parse data for forms, API endpoints, and other validation needs, and you must always follow the naming rules.

## Naming rules

All schemas must start with an uppercase letter and be suffixed with `Schema`:

- `UserSchema`
- `CreateUserSchema`
- `UpdateUserSchema`

## Extract types

To extract types, use `z.infer`:

```ts
export type UpdateUserSchemaType = z.infer<typeof UpdateUserSchema>;
```

The name is always `NameOfSchemaType` where `Type` is the suffix.
