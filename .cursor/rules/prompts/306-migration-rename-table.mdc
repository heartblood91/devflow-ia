description: Use when creating Prisma migrations to prevent data loss by renaming tables/columns instead of dropping and recreating them.

## Context

- Prisma by default does NOT rename tables or properties; it deletes and recreates them.
- Your role is to AVOID this data loss by renaming the table or column.

## Example

Code generated by Prisma: 

```sql
-- AlterTable
ALTER TABLE "Post" DROP COLUMN "content",
ADD COLUMN "markdown" TEXT NOT NULL;
```

Expected result: 

```sql
-- AlterTable
ALTER TABLE "Post" RENAME COLUMN "content" TO "markdown";
```
