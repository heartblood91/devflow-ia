## Context:

- Create components following Test-Driven Development principles.
- Apply only to components that don't require integration tests (such as database interactions).
- Always create the test file first, then implement the component.

## Workflow

1. Plan the implementation: component location, naming, and structure.
2. Create a test file in the `__tests__` folder.
3. Create the component in the appropriate folder (e.g., `src/features`).
4. Run tests with `pnpm test:ci`.
5. Iterate on the component implementation until all tests pass.
