## Context:

- Create components following TDD principles.
- Create components with full integration tests.
- You must FIRST create the integration test file, then generate the code.

## Workflow

0. Search the file and read the code that needs to be edited.
0. Plan what you will do, such as where the components will be created and the component name.
1. Create a test file in the `e2e` folder.
2. Create the component and the page in the correct folder following routes.mdc and all project rules.
3. Run the tests with `pnpm test:e2e:ci -g "name-of-the-test"`.
4. Correct the component until the tests pass.

## Debug

* You can use `page.evaluate` to test the content.
* You can use `console.log` inside the page to understand the issues.
* You CAN'T use screenshots.
* You CAN'T use `page.pause()`.

## Important information

* Most tables are Organization-related and must be created inside /orgs/[orgSlug] folder.
