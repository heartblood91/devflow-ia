## Context

- Playwright is the tool for creating end-to-end tests.
- Create test files in the `e2e/` folder.

## Auto-correction

- Create the test first, then use `pnpm test:e2e:ci -g "test-name"` to verify and auto-correct the implementation.

## Database access

- Always use [prisma.ts](mdc:src/lib/prisma.ts) for database access.

## Utils file

- [auth-test.ts](mdc:e2e/utils/auth-test.ts)

## Rules

- Always remove console.log statements after tests pass.
